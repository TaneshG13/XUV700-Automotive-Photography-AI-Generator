# üì∏ XUV700 Automotive Photography AI Generator

This project leverages the power of **Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)** to create a collection of professional, high-quality, and hyperrealistic automotive photographs featuring a **white Mahindra XUV700 SUV** in diverse and iconic Indian locations.

The pipeline is designed to be executed within a Google Colab environment to utilize a free-tier GPU.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Model:** Utilizes **Stable Diffusion XL 1.0** for state-of-the-art image quality.
* **Locations:** Generates images across three distinct, pre-defined Indian backdrops:
    * **Bandra-Worli Sea Link, Mumbai** (Monsoon and Night shots)
    * **Hawa Mahal, Jaipur** (Market and Dusk shots)
    * **Nagpur Rainforest** (Waterfall and Misty Morning shots)
* **Optimization:** Includes memory-saving techniques like **`enable_model_cpu_offload()`** and **`enable_vae_slicing()`** for efficient GPU usage.
* **Automated Workflow:** Handles setup, generation, saving, metadata tracking, and final packaging into a downloadable ZIP file.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

* **Google Colab Pro/Plus** (Recommended for faster execution and better GPU access, though a free-tier GPU works).
* A **Hugging Face Account** and a **User Access Token** with **Write** permission to login via `notebook_login()`.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Setup

The included Colab notebook handles all installation steps automatically.

1.  **Install Libraries:** Installs and upgrades `diffusers`, `transformers`, `accelerate`, and `huggingface_hub`.
2.  **Restart Session:** Requires a runtime restart to correctly load the new library versions.
3.  **Hugging Face Login:** Prompts the user to log in to Hugging Face to access the SDXL model weights.

## üöÄ The Generation Pipeline

The core logic is encapsulated in the `XUV700ImageGenerator` class, which follows a systematic sequence:

### 1. Initialization and Model Loading

The generator class initializes, creates the output directory structure (`xuv700_output_new/`), and loads the `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0` model.

* **Device:** Automatically detects and uses **`cuda`** (GPU).
* **Optimization:** **FP16** precision, CPU offload, and VAE slicing are enabled to manage the large model size.

### 2. Prompt Configuration

A detailed configuration dictionary (`prompt_config`) holds all the generation parameters. Each location has a common **`base`** prompt and two unique, descriptive **`angles`** to create a varied portfolio.

| Location | Base Prompt Snippet | Angles (Theme) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bandra-Worli Sea Link** | `...white Mahindra XUV700 SUV on the Bandra-Worli Sea Link...` | **Dramatic Monsoon** (Rain-slicked asphalt, storm clouds) **Vibrant Night Shot** (Long exposure, light trails) |
| **Hawa Mahal** | `...white Mahindra XUV700 SUV in Jaipur, with the Hawa Mahal...` | **Bustling Street Market** (Motion blur, vibrant stalls) **Serene Dusk View** (Rooftop cafe perspective, warm lights) |
| **Nagpur Rainforest** | `...white Mahindra XUV700 SUV in a lush Nagpur rainforest...` | **Cascading Waterfall** (Mist, filtered sunlight, water droplets) **Early Misty Morning** (Fog, diffused lighting, headlights on) |

### 3. Image Generation

The `generate_all_images()` method iterates through the 3 locations and 2 angles (6 images total).

* **Settings:**
    * **Steps:** 40
    * **Guidance Scale:** 7.5
    * **Resolution:** 1024x1024
    * **Seeding:** Uses a base seed (`base_seed=101`) and increments it for each image to ensure unique, reproducible results.

### 4. Output and Packaging

* **Saving:** Each generated image is saved to its respective subdirectory (e.g., `xuv700_output_new/hawa_mahal/angle_1.png`).
* **Metadata:** A `metadata.json` file is saved, containing the full prompt, seed, and file path for every generated image.
* **Zipping & Download:** The final step compresses the entire `xuv700_output_new` directory into a **`xuv700_output_new.zip`** file and initiates the download in the browser.

## üñºÔ∏è Expected Results

The pipeline successfully generates 6 unique, high-resolution (1024x1024) images. Below are examples of the diverse styles generated by the prompts:

---

### **1. Bandra-Worli Sea Link (Mumbai)**

| Angle 1: Dramatic Monsoon Scene | Angle 2: Vibrant Night Shot |
| :---: | :---: |
| *Expected: Dark storm clouds, rain-slicked road, wide-angle lens for scale.* | *Expected: Long exposure light trails, illuminated bridge, high-contrast city lights.* |

---

### **2. Hawa Mahal (Jaipur)**

| Angle 1: Bustling Street Market View | Angle 2: Serene Dusk View |
| :---: | :---: |
| *Expected: Car as sharp focal point, motion-blurred market crowd, street-level.* | *Expected: Rooftop cafe perspective, warmly lit Hawa Mahal against deep blue sky.* |

---

### **3. Nagpur Rainforest**

| Angle 1: Cascading Waterfall | Angle 2: Early Misty Morning |
| :---: | :---: |
| *Expected: Car parked by a waterfall, sunlight filtering through the canopy, adventurous feel.* | *Expected: Fog weaving through trees, soft diffused light, headlights cutting through mist.* |
